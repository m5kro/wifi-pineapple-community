To ease code reviews please follow the [PSR-1](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-1/) and
[PSR-2](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/). Take a few minutes to actually read them,
they're not all that bad. To jump right in use the [PHP-CS-Fixer
tool](http://cs.sensiolabs.org/). Or install PHP_CodeSniffer and use it like so:

`apt install php-codesniffer`

`phpcs --standard=PSR2 your_file.php`
