# Welcome

The WiFi Pineapple is more than hardware or software -- it's home to a helpful community of creative penetration testers and IT professionals. Welcome!

This wiki is intended to advise newcomers to the WiFi Pineapple project on the vast intricacies of this most powerful and versatile wireless auditing platform. 

As the platform evolves, this wiki will be updated from time to time.

## About the WiFi Pineapple

The WiFi Pineapple® NANO and TETRA are the 6th generation auditing platforms from Hak5 LLC. Thoughtfully developed for mobile and persistent deployments, they build on over 8 years of WiFi penetration testing expertise.

At the core of the WiFi Pineapple is PineAP, an advanced suite of wireless penetration testing tools for reconnaissance, man-in-the-middle, tracking, logging and reporting. Utilizing our unique hardware design, PineAP is the most effective rogue access point suite available.

Simplicity is key to any successful audit, which is why management of the WiFi Pineapple is conducted from an intuitive web interface. Built on modern standards for speed and responsiveness, the beautiful web interface puts the penetration tester in control from any device.

As a platform, the WiFi Pineapple is home to numerous community developed modules which add features and extend functionality. Modules install free directly from the web interface in seconds. Developing modules is made straightforward with an API friendly to coders at any experience level.

## The PineAP Suite

PineAP is a highly effective rogue access point suite for the WiFi Pineapple. Building on the simple probe request and response nature of Karma, PineAP takes the technique to the extreme. By utilizing its purpose engineered software in conjunction with the unique multi-radio design of the WiFi Pineapple, we're able to thoroughly mimic preferred networks with precision client targeting. This sophisticated technique can be launched against key individuals or entire organizations, enabling the penetration tester to precisely orchestrate the airwaves. The end result is a man-in-the-middle position, enabling complete network traffic monitoring and control.

From Bring-Your-Own-Device policy management, to remote access penetration testing - the WiFi Pineapple with PineAP is your wireless auditing solution.

Any successful wireless audit begins with good situational awareness. To that end, the PineAP Recon feature provides the penetration tester with a contextual view of the WiFi landscape. Unlike traditional "war driving", whereby the auditor passively listens for beacons being advertised by Access Points to paint a picture of the surrounding WiFi landscape, the WiFi Pineapple’s Recon Mode goes one giant step further.

By monitoring WiFi channels for all data activity, PineAP's Recon paints a complete picture by showing both Access Points and their respective clients in a parent-child table view. What's more, the elements of the WiFi landscape, such as SSID and Hardware address, support contextual hooks to PineAP functions and WiFi Pineapple modules. By tapping a client or access point, the penetration tester has full control of the situation. If PineAP is the ammunition, Recon is the battlefield.

Respecting the scope of engagement is critical to a successful wireless audit. Limiting the penetration test to specified clients ensures zero collateral damage. PineAP on the WiFi Pineapple supports advanced filtering and targeting capabilities. With allow and deny lists for both SSID and client Hardware address, the PineAP suite prevents unwanted devices from accessing the honeypot network.

Filter by single client of interest or entire organizations - all from the Recon view. In addition to filtering, PineAP is especially effective at snaring individual clients. The entire PineAP technique can be targeted towards a specific device, concealing the technique to bystanders.

Central to the PineAP suite is the self named engine. It combines multiple components to deliver customized techniques. This flexibility gives the penetration tester a wide range of intelligence gathering options. From stealth monitoring to passively honeypots to active and targeted techniques, the PineAP engine is as versatile as it is powerful.

Keeping tabs on the WiFi landscape is made simple with a reporting component, enabling the penetration tester to locally capture, or receive by email, automated reports at set intervals. This is especially useful for unmanned, remotely deployed WiFi Pineapple nodes. Additionally the comprehensive logging engine enables advanced analytics.

Keeping tabs on client devices of interest is also within the realms of PineAP through Tracking. The advanced engine powering the PineAP Recon module enables the penetration tester to execute customized functions whenever devices of interest are seen in the vicinity.

Finally, complementing the PineAP suite is a multitude of community developed modules. Available as free over the air downloads, these modules provide enhancements and additional features to the WiFi Pineapple.

In conclusion, using PineAP on the WiFi Pineapple, the penetration tester is able to immediately identify, audit and analyze vulnerabilities within the wireless landscape.
